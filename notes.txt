For Cucumber framework we will need the following 3 dependencies:
cucumber-java, cucumber-core, cucumber-junit

In Cucumber framework:
  - the test scenarios are put in a feature file which are usually are created under resources folder
  - the feature file scenario steps are connected to step definitions through @CucumberOptions glue option in Runner class
      // Cucumber scenario step is matched to step definition method using the text of the scenario step
      // either with Regular Expressions or Cucumber Expressions
  - tags are the main way to control what scenario or feature files
  - Background -> the common steps for ALL scenarios of a feature file can be moved to Background steps
  - Hooks -> Step definition methods annotated with @Before and @After that are executed before/after each SCENARIO
             The annotated methods can be added into any class under Step Definitions folder but usually added into a separate class


  Cucumber parametrized step enables the step to be used multiple times with different sets of data and prevents multiple step snippet generation

  Cucumber automatically converts matching types(String,int, double) from scenario step into corresponding parameter({string},{int},{double}) and adds it to a snippet method as a parameter:
  Ex:
      Scenario Step:           Given I have 5 pounds of cucumbers of type "Cuke" that cost me 5.99 dollars

      Generated snippet:        @Given("I have {int} pounds of cucumbers of type {string} that cost me {double} dollars")
                                public void i_have_pounds_of_cucumbers_of_type_that_cost_me_dollars(Integer int1, String string, Double double1) {

                                }
